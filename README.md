=====

JsonR is a JSON implementation that deals with multiple / circular references. You can find a detailed explanation of this library in a dedicated DZone article: http://java.dzone.com/articles/json-r-json-extension-deals.

Testing with Node.js
--------------------

1. Install Node.js from: http://nodejs.org/.
2. Clone this repository somewhere (say /path/to/jsonr).
3. Run the server with the following commands:

   ````
   $ cd /path/to/jsonr
   $ node jsonr-server.js
   ````
4. Point your browser to: http://localhost:8080/index.html.

Play with the sample application and have a look at the source code.
